# Electron - Conway's Game Of Life

## Description
I wanted to learn electron. I know javascript well, I just wanted to produce a app in this framework. It's rather generic and vanilla.

Conway's game of life is a classic computer science challange. It's a simulation of "Live" and "Dead" pixels. Depending on their neighbours they live, die or spawn.
